# Snippet

Collections of ui components built by smintfy. Feel free to play with them.

## Tech Stack

Snippet is primarily built with Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Motion.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Motivation

Snippet is built as a playground for learning and experiment. By open sourcing the code, I hope other people can learn from it as well.
